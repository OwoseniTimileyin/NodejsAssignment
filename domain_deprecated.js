/*
Module name: domain- Deprecated. To handle unhandled errors
Description : The domain module in Node.js provides a way of handling errors that occur in asynchronous code. It does this by creating a "domain" object that can be used to group related asynchronous operations. When an error occurs in an operation that is part of a domain, the domain object will be notified. This allows you to handle the error in a consistent way, regardless of where it occurs.

// code snippet

const domain = require('domain');

const myDomain = domain.create();

// This function will be called if an error occurs in any of the following operations
myDomain.on('error', (err) => {
// Handle the error here
});

// This asynchronous operation is part of the domain
myDomain.run(() => {
// Do something asynchronous
});

// This asynchronous operation is also part of the domain
myDomain.run(() => {
// Do something else asynchronous
});
